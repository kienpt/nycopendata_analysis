run comparison.py which will take lower_data.csv as the input and give similarity.csv as output which will contain the similarity for each pair.

run removeone.py which will take similarity.csv as the input and remove pairs with lower similarity.

Then you can sort the data using office or other sorting algorithm

lower_data.csv contains all the extracted data which is ready for comarison after removing the stop-words, underscore etc.

forgraph.csv contains the similarity rounded up to two digits after decimal points and number of pairs having that similarity

running generate.py and mentioning the threshhold, will generate the graph

duplicate.csv contains the duplicated pairs of datasets

data_norecords.csv contains the datasets which donot contain a single entry.

sort -k3 -r file_to sort > output_file
