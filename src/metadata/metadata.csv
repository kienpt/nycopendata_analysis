Records contain 2010 College-bound seniors mean SAT scores. 

Records with 5 or fewer students are suppressed (marked ‘s’). 

College-bound seniors are those students that complete the SAT Questionnaire when they register for the SAT and identify that they will graduate from high school in a specific year. For example, the 2010 college-bound seniors are those students that self-reported they would graduate in 2010. Students are not required to complete the SAT Questionnaire in order to register for the SAT. Students who do not indicate which year they will graduate from high school will not be included in any college-bound senior report.  

Students are linked to schools by identifying which school they attend when registering for a College Board exam. A student is only included in a school’s report if he/she self-reports being enrolled at that school.

This is the 3ft version of the high-resolution land cover dataset for New York City. Seven land cover classes were mapped: (1) tree canopy, (2) grass/shrub, (3) bare earth, (4) water, (5) buildings, (6) roads, and (7) other paved surfaces.  The minimum mapping unit for the delineation of features was set at 3 square feet. The primary sources used to derive this land cover layer were the 2010 LiDAR and the 2008 4-band orthoimagery.  Ancillary data sources included GIS data (city boundary, building footprints, water, parking lots, roads, railroads, railroad structures, ballfields) provided by New York City (all ancillary datasets except railroads); UVM Spatial Analysis Laboratory manually created railroad polygons from manual interpretation of 2008 4-band orthoimagery.  The tree canopy class was considered current as of 2010; the remaining land-cover classes were considered current as of 2008. Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) techniques were employed to extract land cover information using the best available remotely sensed and vector GIS datasets.  OBIA systems work by grouping pixels into meaningful objects based on their spectral and spatial properties, while taking into account boundaries imposed by existing vector datasets.  Within the OBIA environment a rule-based expert system was designed to effectively mimic the process of manual image analysis by incorporating the elements of image interpretation (color/tone, texture, pattern, location, size, and shape) into the classification process.  A series of morphological procedures were employed to insure that the end product is both accurate and cartographically pleasing. More than 35,000 corrections were made to the classification.  Overall accuracy was 96%. This dataset was developed as part of the Urban Tree Canopy (UTC) Assessment for New York City.  As such, it represents a 'top down' mapping perspective in which tree canopy over hanging other features is assigned to the tree canopy class.  At the time of its creation this dataset represents the most detailed and accurate land cover dataset for the area. This project was funded by National Urban and Community Forestry Advisory Council (NUCFAC) and the National Science Fundation (NSF), although it is not specifically endorsed by either agency.  The methods used were developed by the University of Vermont Spatial Analysis Laboratory, in collaboration with the New York City Urban Field Station, with funding from the USDA Forest Service.	1340901904arq3-7z49	Subway Stations	0	897	1360607239	City Subway Stations	1318010211t9k3-tbwy	Elevation	0	878	1358186028	Planimetric basemap layer containing elevations	1333133741uady-p6yt	Map View	0	843	1318031333	A list of laundry facilities that have a current DCA license as of the run date.	1318031267fuvx-wqd7	2011-2012 NYC Family Guides	0	327	1324141113	2011-2012 NYC Family Guides

Notes:
As of 2006, the New York State Education Department expanded the ELA and mathematics testing programs to Grades 3-8. Previously, state tests were administered in Grades 4 and 8 and citywide tests were administered in Grades 3, 5, 6, and 7.
In 2006, NYSED treated District 75 students as a distinct geographic district. For 2007-2011, District 75 students are represented in their home districts and boroughs. Spreadsheets for District and Borough do not include District 75 students in 2006.
Starting in 2010, NYSED changed the scale score required to meet each of the proficiency levels, increasing the number of questions students needed to answer correctly to meet proficiency.

Rows are suppressed (noted with ‘s’) if the number of tested students was 5 or fewer. 
Prior to 2011, the mean scale scores for ‘All Grades’ were not calculated.	1318356727vvj6-d5qx	2010 & 2011 NYC Municipal Building Energy Benchmarking Results	1	551	1348248220	This is an Excel file with a list of New York City municipal buildings over 10,000 square feet by borough, block, lot, and agency, identifying each building’s energy intensity (kBtu/sq. ft.), Portfolio Manager benchmarking rating, where available, and the total GHG emissions for the calendar years 2010 & 2011.	1346795229uedp-fegm	Natural Gas Consumption by ZIP Code - 2010	0	628	1360681049	2010 Natural Gas consumption in therms and GJ, by ZIP code, building type, and utility company.	1318357168brrx-dg4s	Yellow Medallion Taxicabs - Drivers	0	650	1319235474	Yellow Medallion Taxicabs are the official taxis of New York City.

The NYC Office of Long-Term Planning and Sustainability (NYC OLTPS) and the City of New York assume no responsibility for the accuracy of this data or its suitability for any purposes. All users should independently verify the accuracy of the data for their purposes. This data on 1-in-100 year flood zones for New York City with Projected Sea Level Rise was produced by the Institute for Sustainable Cities, City University of New York for an analysis of large geographic areas only. 1.	Methods and Caveat – The projected flood extents included in this data reflect a “bathtub” methodology whereby a flood elevation is extrapolated landward until it reaches the equivalent contour height on land. This approach does not account for cumulative effects of soils, vegetation, surface permeability, bathymetry, infrastructure and beach structures, friction, and other factors that affect the movement of floodwaters resulting in local variations in flooding extent. 2.	Error – Numerous sources of potential error are present in the data. These include limitations of model input and scope (climate and FEMA floodplain models), error inherent in model output, errors in and coarseness of topography, the rounding of base flood elevations to the nearest foot, and in GIS technique. 3.	Interpretation - The floodplains delineated in this data do not represent precise flood boundaries but rather illustrate two distinct areas of interest: A) areas that do not currently flood but are expected to potentially do so in the future and B) areas that do not currently flood and are unlikely to do so in the timeline of this research.	1340914073w3c6-35wg	Community District Breakdowns	0	301	1321290388	Demographic statistics broken down by community districts	1318116109gzm9-7ytn	Birth Rate by Mother’s Age, 2007	0	280	1318378466	Rate of birth sorted by the age range of the mother.

Survey results provide insight into a school's learning environment and contribute a measure of diversification that goes beyond test scores on the Progress Report. NYC School Survey results contribute 10% - 15% of a school's Progress Report grade (the exact contribution to the Progress Report is dependant on school type). Survey questions assess the community's opinions on academic expectations, communication, engagement, and safety and respect. School leaders can use survey results to better understand their own school's strengths and target areas for improvement. 

The NYC School Survey helps school leaders understand what key members of the school community say about the learning environment at each school. The information captured by the survey is designed to support a dialogue among all members of the school community about how to make the school a better place to learn. 

New York City parents, students, and teachers reached new all-time participation highs on the 2011 School Survey. 960,191 surveys were submitted.	1318355718uzcy-9puk	311 Service Requests for 2008	0	229	1343772141	311 Service Requests for 2008.

This dataset consists of TC metrics summarized to several different sets of geographic base layers. The metrics presented in this table are based on 2010 high resolution land cover dataset.

The TC Assessment is a top-down approach to analyzing the forest.  Its purpose is to integrate high resolution land cover data with other GIS datasets to produce a set of detailed metrics on the forest that allow decision makers to know how much tree canopy currently exists (termed Existing TC) and amount of land where is it biophysically feasible to establish tree canopy on (termed Possible TC). 

Existing TC is determined by extracting all features classified as tree canopy from a high resolution land cover dataset.  Possible TC is determined by identifying land where canopy could possibly exist.  Possible TC in a GIS context is determined by overlaying high resolution land cover with cadastral and planimetric datasets to include building polygons and road polygons.  

Possible TC is queried out from this overlay and consists of all land that was not existing canopy, not water, not a building, and not a road.  Possible TC is further divided into two subcategories:  Possible-impervious and Possible-vegetation.  Possible-impervious consists of all impervious land that, through modification, could support tree canopy.  Examples of such features are parking lots, driveways (through overhanging coverage) and playgrounds.  Possible-vegetation consists of all land that is low-lying vegetation, primarily grass or shrubs, which could conceivably be converted to support tree canopy.  Examples of such features include residential lawns and playing fields.  TC metrics do not serve to address the issues of where it is socially desirable or financially feasible to plant trees.  Rather, the TC metrics serve as the basis for beginning to form answers to these questions.   

TC metrics are presented in the attribute table as both absolute area (in map units) and relative area (percentage of land area) per parcel.  For example, an Existing TC Area (TC_E_A) value of 13,677 and an Existing TC Percentage (TC_E_P) of 21.8 indicate that for the parcel in question the area of Existing TC is 13,677 (in map units) and 21.8% of that feature is tree canopy.   This assessment was completed by the University of Vermont's Spatial Analysis Laboratory with funding from National Urban and Community Forestry Advisory Council (NUCFAC) and the National Science Fundation (NSF) and in cooperation with the USDA Forest Service's Northern Research Station.

The TC Assessment protocols were developed by the USDA Forest Service's Northern Research Station and the University of Vermont's Spatial Analysis Laboratory in collaboration with the Maryland Department of Natural Resources.  TC assessments have been conducted for numerous communities throughout the U.S. where the results have been instrumental in helping to establishing TC goals.	13409026776rdw-7wk8	Map of Handball Courts	0	277	1319574206	GIS Map of Handball Courts in New York City Department of Parks & Recreation properties.

Peer indexes are calculated differently depending on School Level.  Schools are only compared to other schools in the same School Level (e.g., Elementary, K-8, Middle, High, Transfer)

1) Elementary, K-8, K-3, K-2 - peer index is a value from 0-100.  We use a composite demographic statistic based on % ELL, % SpEd, % Title I free lunch, and % Black/Hispanic.  Higher values indicate student populations with higher need.

2) Middle - peer index is a value from 1.00-4.50.  For middle schools, we use the average 4th grade proficiency ratings in ELA and Math and the % SpEd. Lower values indicate student populations with higher need.

3) High School - peer index is a value from 1.00-4.50. For high schools, we use the average 8th grade proficiency, the % SpEd, the % Self-contained, and the % overage. Lower values indicate student populations with higher need.	1318357744v8qe-fx6p	Times Square Hotels	0	244	1318344470	Directory of hotels in the Times Square area

Peer indexes are calculated differently depending on School Level.  Schools are only compared to other schools in the same School Level (e.g., Elementary, K-8, Middle, High, Transfer)

1) Elementary, K-8, Early Childhood - peer index is a value from 0-100.  A composite demographic statistic based on % ELL, % Students with Disabilities, % Title I free lunch, and % Black/Hispanic is used.  Higher values indicate student populations with higher need.

2) Middle - peer index is a value from 1.00-4.50.  For middle schools, the average 4th grade proficiency ratings in ELA and Math and the % Students with Disabilities is used. Lower values indicate student populations with higher need.

3) High School - peer index is a value from 1.00-4.50. For high schools, the average 8th grade proficiency, the % Students with Disabilities, the % Self-contained, and the % overage is used. Lower values indicate student populations with higher need.	1318357593qfva-z2r5	Flood Plain Scenario - Rapid Ice Melt (2020/2050/2080)	0	180	1360855104	This file contains 3 sets of shapefiles representing possible Flood Hazard Zone Areas in the 2020's, 2050's, and 2080's, based upon a rapid ice melt scenario.

The NYC Office of Long-Term Planning and Sustainability (NYC OLTPS) and the City of New York assume no responsibility for the accuracy of this data or its suitability for any purposes.  All users should independently verify the accuracy of the data for their purposes.  This data on 1-in-100 year flood zones for New York City with Projected Sea Level Rise was produced by the Institute for Sustainable Cities, City University of New York for an analysis of large geographic areas only. 

1.	Methods and Caveat – The projected flood extents included in this data reflect a “bathtub” methodology whereby a flood elevation is extrapolated landward until it reaches the equivalent contour height on land. This approach does not account for cumulative effects of soils, vegetation, surface permeability, bathymetry, infrastructure and beach structures, friction, and other factors that affect the movement of floodwaters resulting in local variations in flooding extent.
2.	Error – Numerous sources of potential error are present in the data. These include limitations of model input and scope (climate and FEMA floodplain models), error inherent in model output, errors in and coarseness of topography, the rounding of base flood elevations to the nearest foot, and in GIS technique.
3.	Interpretation - The floodplains delineated in this data do not represent precise flood boundaries but rather illustrate two distinct areas of interest: A) areas that do not currently flood but are expected to potentially do so in the future and B) areas that do not currently flood and are unlikely to do so in the timeline of this research.	1340913710u6gg-xejf	Vacant Lots Cleaned	0	168	1329414446	Gives address, Borough-Block-Lot of each vacant lot cleaned by DSNY forces during the report month.

¶•The New York State Education Department adopted Aspirational Performance Measures (APM) in addition to high school graduation rates for the Cohort of 2006 (Class of 2010). In addition to the numbers of students earning Advanced Regents Designation on their diplomas, another metric was developed based on performance on Math and ELA Regents exams. The Math/ELA APM represents the percentage of students in the cohort who graduated with any regular diploma (Regents Diploma with Advanced Designation, Regents Diploma, or Local Diploma) and who scored 80 or greater on their highest mathematics Regents and 75 or greater on the English Regents. Since this metric is new for the Class of 2010, only one year of results is reported, separately for June and August graduation cohorts. The total number of students in the cohort is the same in June and August. 
¶•Records with cohorts of 20 students or less are suppressed. 
¶•August outcomes include all June and August graduates. 
¶•In school-level reporting, students who were in a school for less than 5 months are not included in the school’s cohort, but are included in citywide totals. 
¶•School level results are not presented for District 79 schools, but their outcomes are included in citywide totals. 
¶•Schools that had previously obtained a waiver to use alternative assessments (rather than Regents examinations) were omitted from the Math/ELA APM calculations.	1318975130w46b-46c5	Map of Tennis Courts	0	171	1319575724	GIS Map of Tennis Courts in New York City Department of Parks & Recreation properties.	1318116931tic6-5xzi	Graffiti	0	172	1338317441	Addresses, current status, and coordinates of requests to clean graffiti (other than bridges or highways) received from the public and SCOUT in the last 12 months.	1318105451vg63-xw6u	2009 Campaign Expenditures	0	171	1318111062	A listing of campaign expenditures for candidates for City office during the 2009 election cycle	1318111062t6wx-qufc	Laundromats Map	0	171	1335084814	A list of laundry facilities that have a current DCA license as of the run date.	1318031267sapz-4gsi	Approved registrants in the wholesale markets	0	160	1318109493	Approved registrants in the wholesale markets	1318109493khkb-h6hx	Empower Zones	0	139	1360611842	Empower Zones	13181153259bmk-bbj5	English Language Arts (ELA) Test Results by Grade 2006-2011 - Citywide - All Students	0	168	1319230029	New York City Results on the New York State English Language Arts (ELA) Tests, Grades 3 - 8

As of 2006, the New York State Education Department expanded the ELA and mathematics testing programs to Grades 3-8. Previously, state tests were administered in Grades 4 and 8 and citywide tests were administered in Grades 3, 5, 6, and 7.
Starting in 2010, NYSED changed the scale score required to meet each of the proficiency levels, increasing the number of questions students needed to answer correctly to meet proficiency.
In 2007, the New York State Education Department updated its testing policy for English Language Learners: ELLs in an English Language School System for more than one year are required to take the ELA exam. Previously, ELLs in an English Language School System for less than 3 years were exempt from taking the ELA exam.	1318353377rwa3-b3wr	School Progress Reports - All Schools - 2011 Multiyear Summary	0	167	1319235276	2006-07 to 2009-10 Progress Report results summary for all schools

Peer indices are calculated differently depending on School Level.  Schools are only compared to other schools in the same School Level (e.g., Elementary, K-8, Middle, High)

1) Elementary & K-8 - peer index is a value from 0-100.  We use a composite demographic statistic based on % ELL, % SpEd, % Title I free lunch, and % Black/Hispanic.  Higher values indicate student populations with higher need

2) Middle & High - peer index is a value from 1.00-4.50.  For middle schools, we use the average 4th grade proficiency ratings in ELA and Math for all their students that have 4th grade test scores.  For high schools, we use the average 8th grade proficiency ratings in ELA and Math for all their students that have 8th grade test scores.  Lower values indicate student populations with higher need

3) D84 / Charter Schools - the overall score does not include the results of the learning environment survey. 

4) Schools for Transfer Students - consists of schools with large populations of high school students transferring from NYC High Schools or from out of state/country.  No peer index value is assigned because this set of schools is its own peer group. The reports contain 3 categories with one additional credit section.  Unlike the HS Progress Report, the Environment Category is only composed of Survey Results.  Performance measures 6-year graduation rate and Progress captures student level improvements in attendance, credit accumulation and Regents passed.  The additional credit section rewards schools demonstrating exceptional achievement (11 credits or more earned per year) among overage/under-credit populations.	1318355671hm7r-w4y9	DOC Visitor Arrests	0	109	1318362212	Visitor arrests by fiscal year	1317946678vucf-snzd	useful boiler info	0	109	1341091023	Detailed data on NYC buildings with oil boilers, including fuel consumption, BBL, building owner/management info, deadline for complying with Audit and Retrocommissioning Law, building type and year constructed, number of floors and residential units, Condo/Coop status, and more.	1317313357hmiz-c43d	2009 birth names (Male White Non Hispanic)	0	109	1360605711	Popular NYC birth names sorted by sex and ethnicity)	1317921392h682-ywyg	DYCD RHY (Runaway and Homeless Youth) Services	0	108	1360613615	Runaway and Homeless Youth Services	1318026985je66-se2r	Open Balance (Manhattan)	0	108	1318124926	Property tax balance and payment information for all active properties	1318124488yitc-zzrc	Directory of Cricket Fields	0	107	1360854155	Directory of Cricket Fields in NYC Parks.	13183514573nja-bsch	NYPL Branch Services - Manhattan	0	106	1320077218	New York Public Library (NYPL) branch services from July 2010 to June 2011(Manhattan)	1320077218wjyf-dyq5	Calendar of Library Events: Classes and Performances	0	106	1361281919	The NYPL calendar	1313522304berx-iad2	dance venues	0	106	1354318637	Listing of all Cultural Institutions in the Department of Cultural Affairs directory	1318031752hv4a-s7jr	Latin Cultural Organizations Map	0	106	1361299715	Listing of Latin cultural organizations	13194805175tbs-b2m3	Mapped View	0	106	1319576098	List of retail location in the DBP district	1317918786ujcn-y8yu	Prequalified Firms	0	106	1318119663	List of firms qualified to perform work for the School Construction Authority, their trades, and the end date of their qualification.	13181191289z9b-6hvk	Latin Media Organizations	0	95	1361299736	Listing of Latin media organizations	1319480197mq6n-s45c	Energy Usage From DOE Buildings	0	94	1360679353	Energy data from a select portfolio of City-owned buildings (DOE)	1346955757p23h-ci72	Greenstreets	0	104	1360854183	A comprehensive shapefile of all small planted areas defined and maintained as Greenstreets.

1) Elementary & K-8 - peer index is a value from 0-100.  We use a composite demographic statistic based on % ELL, % SpEd, % Title I free lunch, and % Black/Hispanic.  Higher values indicate student populations with higher need.

2) Middle & High - peer index is a value from 1.00-4.50.  For middle schools, we use the average 4th grade proficiency ratings in ELA and Math for all their students that have 4th grade test scores.  For high schools, we use the average 8th grade proficiency ratings in ELA and Math for all their students that have 8th grade test scores, % SpEd, and % Overage.  Lower values indicate student populations with higher need.	1318357789fqcv-e9sg	DYCD after-school-programs: Housing	0	93	1318538874	Facilities in New York City, by agency and site, that offer Family Support after-school “Housing Assistance and Advocacy Programs” for adults and young adults ages 18 and up - Department of Youth and Community Development (DYCD).

The survey ranks among the largest surveys of any kind ever conducted nationally. 

Survey results provide insight into a school's learning environment and contribute a measure of diversification that goes beyond test scores on the Progress Report. NYC School Survey results contribute 10% - 15% of a school's Progress Report grade (the exact contribution to the Progress Report is dependent on school type). Survey questions assess the community's opinions on academic expectations, communication, engagement, and safety and respect. School leaders can use survey results to better understand their own school's strengths and target areas for improvement. 

The NYC School Survey helps school leaders understand what key members of the school community say about the learning environment at each school. The information captured by the survey is designed to support a dialogue among all members of the school community about how to make the school a better place to learn. New York City parents, teachers, and students reached new participation heights on the 2010 School Survey. 922,694 surveys were submitted.	1318355737p7p7-wvdw	Open Summonses - Active For-Hire-Vehicle (FHV) Drivers	0	90	1319226830	List of open summonses written against TLC-licensed drivers.

Notes:
As of 2006, the New York State Education Department expanded the ELA and mathematics testing programs to Grades 3-8. Previously, state tests were administered in Grades 4 and 8 and citywide tests were administered in Grades 3, 5, 6, and 7.
In 2006, NYSED treated District 75 students as a distinct geographic district. For 2007-2011, District 75 students are represented in their home districts and boroughs. Spreadsheets for District and Borough do not include District 75 students in 2006.
Starting in 2010, NYSED changed the scale score required to meet each of the proficiency levels, increasing the number of questions students needed to answer correctly to meet proficiency.

Rows are suppressed (noted with ‘s’) if the number of tested students was 5 or fewer. 
Prior to 2011, the mean scale scores for ‘All Grades’ were not calculated.	1318356830mhwy-j5md	Public Health Insurance Enrollment Sites	0	70	1361282999	List of NYC public health insurance enrollment sites	1318115900qhen-5rve	Weekend Traffic Updates	0	79	1319477714	RSS Feed displaying weekend traffic updates	1311987932tmtb-gcc6	NYC Department of Design and Construction (DDC): Open Requests for Proposals	0	79	1361281461	Purpose: Now,  consultants can subscribe to this feed and be informed about the new postings.

Notes:
As of 2006, the New York State Education Department expanded the ELA and mathematics testing programs to Grades 3-8. Previously, state tests were administered in Grades 4 and 8 and citywide tests were administered in Grades 3, 5, 6, and 7.
Starting in 2010, NYSED changed the scale score required to meet each of the proficiency levels, increasing the number of questions students needed to answer correctly to meet proficiency.
In 2007, the New York State Education Department updated its testing policy for English Language Learners: ELLs in an English Language School System for more than one year are required to take the ELA exam. Previously, ELLs in an English Language School System for less than 3 years were exempt from taking the ELA exam.	1318356426xmzf-uf2w	BPL Branches	0	76	1361281710	A list of Brooklyn Public Library Branches, with branch name, locations, directions to, hours of services, name of contact person, and a brief description of the neighborhood the branch services.	1318287750kcw6-iaxw	Hurricane Sandy - Sewer	0	76	1351882203	All 311 Service Requests from 2010 to present.

#Grade 9 not in high schools
##Indicates how special class is delivered

For schools with students in any grades between Kindergarten and 9th grade (where 9th grade is the termination grade for the school), class size is reported by four program areas: general education, special education self-contained class, collaborative team teaching and gifted and talented self-contained class. Within each program area class size is reported by grade or service category, which indicates how a special education self-contained class is delivered. Class size is calculated by dividing the number of students in a program and grade by the number of official classes in that program and grade. 

The following data is excluded from all the reports: District 75 schools, bridge classes which span more than one grade, classes with fewer than five students (for other than special education self-contained classes) and classes with one student (for special education self-contained classes). On the summary reports programs and grades with three or fewer classes are excluded from the citywide, borough and region reports and programs and grades with one class are excluded from the district report. For schools with students in any grades between 9th and 12th grade (where 9th grade is not the termination grade for the school), class size is reported by two program areas: general education and special education. For general education students class size is reported by grade for each core subject area: English, Math, Science and Social Studies. For special education students with a self-contained program recommendation, class size is reported by service category (self-contained or mainstream) for each core subject area. Since high school classes may contain students in multiple grades and programs, class size is calculated by taking a weighted average of all the classes in a core subject area with students in a particular grade or program. For example, there are 75 ninth graders enrolled at a high school. 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 28 students, a second group of 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 25 students, and a third group of 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 30 students. Average class size for ninth grade Math equals: (25x28 + 25x25 + 25x30)/75 = 27.7. 

The Pupil Teacher Ratio is also provided on the school level report. Pupil Teacher Ratio is another means to evaluate the instructional resources provided at a school. Pupil Teacher Ratio for All Students is calculated by dividing the number of students at a school by the number of full-time equivalent teachers, including both teachers in classes taught by two teachers, “cluster” teachers providing instruction in specialized topics like art or science, and teachers providing special education instruction. Pupil Teacher Ratio Excluding Special Education is calculated by dividing the number of non-special education students at a school by the number of full-time equivalent non-special education teachers.	13185276808ddc-rrz2	Airport Point	0	75	1360613798	Center Point of the city airports.	1318023755m9dy-erm4	New Jersey Transit Stations	0	75	1360613853	Location of New Jersey Transit stations (Penn Station).	13181160114bvt-f84g	NYC Tornado - September 16, 2010	0	75	1340976708	DPR complaints for tornado	1361393986sp9a-cd2a	Publicly Accessible Waterfront Spaces (PAWS) Database	0	74	1340901660	This Access database contains information about publicly accessible waterfront spaces in NYC.  The database can be joined to the PAWS shapefile on the PAWS_ID field.

In 2006, NYSED treated District 75 students as a distinct geographic district. For 2007-2011, District 75 students are represented in their home districts and boroughs. Spreadsheets for District and Borough do not include District 75 students in 2006.
Starting in 2010, NYSED changed the scale score required to meet each of the proficiency levels, increasing the number of questions students needed to answer correctly to meet proficiency.

Peer indices are calculated differently depending on School Level.  Schools are only compared to other schools in the same School Level (e.g., Elementary, K-8, Middle, High)

1) Elementary & K-8 - peer index is a value from 0-100.  We use a composite demographic statistic based on % ELL, % SpEd, % Title I free lunch, and % Black/Hispanic.  Higher values indicate student populations with higher need.

2) Middle & High - peer index is a value from 1.00-4.50.  For middle schools, we use the average 4th grade proficiency ratings in ELA and Math for all their students that have 4th grade test scores.  For high schools, we use the average 8th grade proficiency ratings in ELA and Math for all their students that have 8th grade test scores, % SpEd, and % Overage.  Lower values indicate student populations with higher need.

3) Schools for Transfer Students - peer index is a value from 1.00-4.50.  We use the average 8th grade proficiency ratings in ELA and Math for all their students that have 8th grade test scores and the % Overage/Under credited.  Lower values indicate student populations with higher need.  Unlike Elementary, Middle, and High School Progress Reports, the Environment Category is only composed of Survey Results.	13183578653kcn-nsb5	English Language Arts (ELA) Test Results by Grade 2006-2011 - Citywide - by Race-Ethnicity	0	69	1319230245	New York City Results on the New York State English Language Arts (ELA) Tests, Grades 3 - 8

The time it takes the NYPD to resolve substantiated cases is measured from the date that the CCRB physically transferred the case file to the department until the last day of the month in which the department closed the case. The department does not inform the CCRB of its actual disposition date —just the month in which it closed the case. In addition, when the Department Advocate's Office refers a case to a commanding officer for the imposition of a command discipline, the NYPD considers the case closed and reports that closure to the CCRB. It is subsequent to this closure date that the commanding officer decides upon a penalty consistent with the level of command discipline proscribed by the Department Advocate's Office. For cases that proceeded to administrative hearings, the time it takes for judges to render written decisions is included in calculating the department's closure time.

NYC School Survey results contribute 10% - 15% of a school's Progress Report grade (the exact contribution to the Progress Report is dependent on school type). Survey questions assess the community's opinions on academic expectations, communication, engagement, and safety and respect. School leaders can use survey results to better understand their own school's strengths and target areas for improvement. 

The NYC School Survey helps school leaders understand what key members of the school community say about the learning environment at each school. The information captured by the survey is designed to support a dialogue among all members of the school community about how to make the school a better place to learn.

Starting in 2010, NYSED changed the scale score required to meet each of the proficiency levels, increasing the number of questions students needed to answer correctly to meet proficiency.
In 2007, the New York State Education Department updated its testing policy for English Language Learners: ELLs in an English Language School System for more than one year are required to take the ELA exam. Previously, ELLs in an English Language School System for less than 3 years were exempt from taking the ELA exam.	1318353334h7qm-2nji	JFK Airtrain	0	61	1360613981	Line feature representing the JFK airtrain.	1318023854537r-j359	Subway	0	63	1360614187	Map of NYC Subway Entrances	13180096536dv8-fj7e	New York Streets	0	61	1360614297	Planimetric basemap line layer containing the street centerline.

#Grade 9 not in high schools
##Indicates how special class is delivered

For schools with students in any grades between Kindergarten and 9th grade (where 9th grade is the termination grade for the school), class size is reported by four program areas: general education, special education self-contained class, collaborative team teaching and gifted and talented self-contained class. Within each program area class size is reported by grade or service category, which indicates how a special education self-contained class is delivered. Class size is calculated by dividing the number of students in a program and grade by the number of official classes in that program and grade. 

The following data is excluded from all the reports: District 75 schools, bridge classes which span more than one grade, classes with fewer than five students (for other than special education self-contained classes) and classes with one student (for special education self-contained classes). On the summary reports programs and grades with three or fewer classes are excluded from the citywide, borough and region reports and programs and grades with one class are excluded from the district report. For schools with students in any grades between 9th and 12th grade (where 9th grade is not the termination grade for the school), class size is reported by two program areas: general education and special education. For general education students class size is reported by grade for each core subject area: English, Math, Science and Social Studies. For special education students with a self-contained program recommendation, class size is reported by service category (self-contained or mainstream) for each core subject area. Since high school classes may contain students in multiple grades and programs, class size is calculated by taking a weighted average of all the classes in a core subject area with students in a particular grade or program. For example, there are 75 ninth graders enrolled at a high school. 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 28 students, a second group of 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 25 students, and a third group of 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 30 students. Average class size for ninth grade Math equals: (25x28 + 25x25 + 25x30)/75 = 27.7. 

The Pupil Teacher Ratio is also provided on the school level report. Pupil Teacher Ratio is another means to evaluate the instructional resources provided at a school. Pupil Teacher Ratio for All Students is calculated by dividing the number of students at a school by the number of full-time equivalent teachers, including both teachers in classes taught by two teachers, “cluster” teachers providing instruction in specialized topics like art or science, and teachers providing special education instruction. Pupil Teacher Ratio Excluding Special Education is calculated by dividing the number of non-special education students at a school by the number of full-time equivalent non-special education teachers.	1318528003ncbg-6agr	DOF Parking Violation Codes	0	63	1361463945	This dataset defines the parking violation codes in New York City and lists the fines.

Starting in 2010, NYSED changed the scale score required to meet each of the proficiency levels, increasing the number of questions students needed to answer correctly to meet proficiency.
In 2007, the New York State Education Department updated its testing policy for English Language Learners: ELLs in an English Language School System for more than one year are required to take the ELA exam. Previously, ELLs in an English Language School System for less than 3 years were exempt from taking the ELA exam.	1318353173pu5q-qmzc	NCR	0	34	1360615348	Empower Zones	1318115325tes3-xb7k	Board of Education, 1934-2002	0	34	1361280085	"The records of selected individual members of the Board of Education, 1934-2002, documenting the work of the citizen policy making board.

#Grade 9 not in high schools
##Indicates how special class is delivered

For schools with students in any grades between Kindergarten and 9th grade (where 9th grade is the termination grade for the school), class size is reported by four program areas: general education, special education self-contained class, collaborative team teaching and gifted and talented self-contained class. Within each program area class size is reported by grade or service category, which indicates how a special education self-contained class is delivered. Class size is calculated by dividing the number of students in a program and grade by the number of official classes in that program and grade. 

The following data is excluded from all the reports: District 75 schools, bridge classes which span more than one grade, classes with fewer than five students (for other than special education self-contained classes) and classes with one student (for special education self-contained classes). On the summary reports programs and grades with three or fewer classes are excluded from the citywide, borough and region reports and programs and grades with one class are excluded from the district report. For schools with students in any grades between 9th and 12th grade (where 9th grade is not the termination grade for the school), class size is reported by two program areas: general education and special education. For general education students class size is reported by grade for each core subject area: English, Math, Science and Social Studies. For special education students with a self-contained program recommendation, class size is reported by service category (self-contained or mainstream) for each core subject area. Since high school classes may contain students in multiple grades and programs, class size is calculated by taking a weighted average of all the classes in a core subject area with students in a particular grade or program. For example, there are 75 ninth graders enrolled at a high school. 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 28 students, a second group of 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 25 students, and a third group of 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 30 students. Average class size for ninth grade Math equals: (25x28 + 25x25 + 25x30)/75 = 27.7. 

The Pupil Teacher Ratio is also provided on the school level report. Pupil Teacher Ratio is another means to evaluate the instructional resources provided at a school. Pupil Teacher Ratio for All Students is calculated by dividing the number of students at a school by the number of full-time equivalent teachers, including both teachers in classes taught by two teachers, “cluster” teachers providing instruction in specialized topics like art or science, and teachers providing special education instruction. Pupil Teacher Ratio Excluding Special Education is calculated by dividing the number of non-special education students at a school by the number of full-time equivalent non-special education teachers.	1318528130jp7y-czvr	Types Of Allegations In Complaints Received 2005 - 2009	0	33	1317328433	CCRB: Types of Allegations in Complaints Received 2005 - 2009	1317328433d8cz-kh5x	CCRB: Attribution of Complaints to Patrol Borough Staten Island 2005 - 2009	0	33	1318356929	Civilian Complaint Review Board (CCRB) complaint activity data, 2005-2009.

#Grade 9 not in high schools
##Indicates how special class is delivered

For schools with students in any grades between Kindergarten and 9th grade (where 9th grade is the termination grade for the school), class size is reported by four program areas: general education, special education self-contained class, collaborative team teaching and gifted and talented self-contained class. Within each program area class size is reported by grade or service category, which indicates how a special education self-contained class is delivered. Class size is calculated by dividing the number of students in a program and grade by the number of official classes in that program and grade. 

The following data is excluded from all the reports: District 75 schools, bridge classes which span more than one grade, classes with fewer than five students (for other than special education self-contained classes) and classes with one student (for special education self-contained classes). On the summary reports programs and grades with three or fewer classes are excluded from the citywide, borough and region reports and programs and grades with one class are excluded from the district report. For schools with students in any grades between 9th and 12th grade (where 9th grade is not the termination grade for the school), class size is reported by two program areas: general education and special education. For general education students class size is reported by grade for each core subject area: English, Math, Science and Social Studies. For special education students with a self-contained program recommendation, class size is reported by service category (self-contained or mainstream) for each core subject area. Since high school classes may contain students in multiple grades and programs, class size is calculated by taking a weighted average of all the classes in a core subject area with students in a particular grade or program. For example, there are 75 ninth graders enrolled at a high school. 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 28 students, a second group of 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 25 students, and a third group of 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 30 students. Average class size for ninth grade Math equals: (25x28 + 25x25 + 25x30)/75 = 27.7. 

The Pupil Teacher Ratio is also provided on the school level report. Pupil Teacher Ratio is another means to evaluate the instructional resources provided at a school. Pupil Teacher Ratio for All Students is calculated by dividing the number of students at a school by the number of full-time equivalent teachers, including both teachers in classes taught by two teachers, “cluster” teachers providing instruction in specialized topics like art or science, and teachers providing special education instruction. Pupil Teacher Ratio Excluding Special Education is calculated by dividing the number of non-special education students at a school by the number of full-time equivalent non-special education teachers.	1318527840d27a-yn3m	SI	0	27	1341607301	Landmarks Preservation Commission point shapefile.

Peer indices are calculated differently depending on School Level.  Schools are only compared to other schools in the same School Level (e.g., Elementary, K-8, Middle, High)

1) Elementary & K-8 - peer index is a value from 0-100.  We use a composite demographic statistic based on % ELL, % SpEd, % Title I free lunch, and % Black/Hispanic.  Higher values indicate student populations with higher need

2) Middle & High - peer index is a value from 1.00-4.50.  For middle schools, we use the average 4th grade proficiency ratings in ELA and Math for all their students that have 4th grade test scores.  For high schools, we use the average 8th grade proficiency ratings in ELA and Math for all their students that have 8th grade test scores.  Lower values indicate student populations with higher need

3) D84 / Charter Schools - the overall score does not include the results of the learning environment survey. 

4) Schools for Transfer Students - consists of schools with large populations of high school students transferring from NYC High Schools or from out of state/country.  No peer index value is assigned because this set of schools is its own peer group. The reports contain 3 categories with one additional credit section.  Unlike the HS Progress Report, the Environment Category is only composed of Survey Results.  Performance measures 6-year graduation rate and Progress captures student level improvements in attendance, credit accumulation and Regents passed.  The additional credit section rewards schools demonstrating exceptional achievement (11 credits or more earned per year) among overage/under-credit populations.	1318355671d569-p6vu	camp cont	0	11	1352319386	A listing of campaign contributions for candidates for City office during the 2013 election cycle	1315956180pcgw-s47c	English Language Arts (ELA) Test Results by Grade 2006-2011 - Citywide - by Disability Status	0	11	1319230155	New York City Results on the New York State English Language Arts (ELA) Tests, Grades 3 - 8

Cardozo initiated the Public Service Program - a private/public partnership with the City's prominent law firms, where firms either lend their attorneys to the Law Department for a finite period of time or agree to take on City cases in-house. The Program benefits both the City and the law firms. The City receives the assistance of an incredibly well-trained and talented group of attorneys while the attorneys receive the kind of hands-on, in-court litigation experience that is often hard to come by at the best private law firms. While participation in the Program will not lead to offers of permanent employment at the Law Department, it will enable the volunteers to keep their skills fresh while serving the public. 
Trial Attorney Volunteers: A number of firms lend mid-level litigation associates to the Law Department for a period of four to six months to work full-time in our Tort Division trial units. These attorneys conduct back-to-back civil trials, selecting juries, examining and cross-examining witnesses and presenting opening statements and closing arguments.
Law Firm Volunteers: Other firms have chosen to take entire matters in-house, giving their attorneys the chance to participate in court conferences, settlement negotiations, depositions, and, ultimately, trials.
Deposition Program: Firms also lend associates to the Law Department either to conduct a series of depositions in an individual case or to spend two to three weeks in our offices conducting back-to-back depositions in a variety of cases.	13601748982ghx-qqsj	Certificate of Fitness Schedule of Fees	0	9	1360620613	Certificate of Fitness Schedule of Fees	1359664683wuqd-9nwq	Directory Of Important DPR Employees By Borough	0	9	1359577604	List of Important Employees in Department of Parks and Recreation by Borough	1359065547fbsa-93dh	Directory Of Zoning Details	0	10	1360785012	Details about different zones and corresponding dwelling unit limit	1360785012hkud-vzzj	Office Locations	0	9	1360944130	Department Of Probation Office Address	1360689672su6u-afcg	Family & Adult Court Contact Information	0	10	1360944018	This is the contact list for the Family and Adult Court Information.	136069166469w5-fdhb	Justice Scholars Organization  Information	0	9	1360943916	These are the address of Organizations providing Justice Scholars Programs	1360692332n2fr-mrwg	Universal	0	9	1337716020	All 311 Service Requests from 2010 to present.

Peer indices are calculated differently depending on School Level.  Schools are only compared to other schools in the same School Level (e.g., Elementary, K-8, Middle, High)

1) Elementary & K-8 - peer index is a value from 0-100.  We use a composite demographic statistic based on % ELL, % SpEd, % Title I free lunch, and % Black/Hispanic.  Higher values indicate student populations with higher need

2) Middle & High - peer index is a value from 1.00-4.50.  For middle schools, we use the average 4th grade proficiency ratings in ELA and Math for all their students that have 4th grade test scores.  For high schools, we use the average 8th grade proficiency ratings in ELA and Math for all their students that have 8th grade test scores.  Lower values indicate student populations with higher need

3) D84 / Charter Schools - the overall score does not include the results of the learning environment survey. 

4) Schools for Transfer Students - consists of schools with large populations of high school students transferring from NYC High Schools or from out of state/country.  No peer index value is assigned because this set of schools is its own peer group. The reports contain 3 categories with one additional credit section.  Unlike the HS Progress Report, the Environment Category is only composed of Survey Results.  Performance measures 6-year graduation rate and Progress captures student level improvements in attendance, credit accumulation and Regents passed.  The additional credit section rewards schools demonstrating exceptional achievement (11 credits or more earned per year) among overage/under-credit populations.	1318355671cg3x-fbax	short list	0	3	1360787787	Detailed data on NYC buildings with oil boilers, including fuel consumption, BBL, building owner/management info, deadline for complying with Audit and Retrocommissioning Law, building type and year constructed, number of floors and residential units, Condo/Coop status, and more.	1317313357gka5-35g6	2013-2-3_adr_wifi	0	3	1359938596	Location of wifi hotspots in the city with basic descriptive information.	1318014001rh8a-x6je	Borough boundaries	0	3	1361072728	GIS data: Boundaries of Boroughs (water areas excluded)	1334082087vmt7-2862	11	0	3	1360617445	GIS data: Boundaries of Boroughs (water areas excluded)	1334082087cr5r-f8bt	311 Service Requests for 2006 New York Data	0	3	1358421497	311 Service Requests for 2006.

The NYPD has provided this data for the 2010-2011 school year to the New York City Department of Education (DOE), covering the period from July 1, 2010-June 30, 2011. The DOE has compiled this data by schools and locations for the information of our parents and students, our teachers and staff, and the general public. 
In some instances, several Department of Education learning communities co-exist within a single building. In other instances, a single school has locations in several different buildings. In either of these instances, the data presented here is aggregated by building location rather than by school, since safety is always a building-wide issue. We use “consolidated locations” throughout the presentation of the data to indicate the numbers of incidents in buildings that include more than one learning community.	1361423818piri-jns7	Quality Review 2005-2012	0	4	1361457221	The Quality Review is a two- or three-day school visit by experienced educators to each New York City school.
